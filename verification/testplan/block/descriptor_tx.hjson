        Tests the descriptor_tx module responsible for processing TTI TX
        descriptors and controlling TTI data flow during I3C private
        reads. Sends a descriptor to the module followed with the right
        amount of data. Verifies that the module accepted the descriptor
        and allowed the right amount of data bytes to pass through it.
